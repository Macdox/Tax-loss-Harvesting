## üìù Assumptions

- The app uses mock data from `src/apis/holding.json` and `src/apis/capitalGains.json`.
- All calculations are for simulation/demo purposes only and do not constitute tax advice.
- "How it works?" tooltip and alert notes are for user education and may be customized.
- The app assumes each holding has a unique `coin` symbol as its identifier.
- The UI is optimized for desktop and modern browsers.
